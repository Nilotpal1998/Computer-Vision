<h1>Covid-19 Detection</h1>
<h3>The Proposed Framework</h3>
<p>As we have limited amount of data i.e we have some constraint over the data sizes we have taken the help of transfer learning to fine tune on our <b><i>COVID-Xray 5-K dataset.</i></b></p>

<h4>Transfer Learning Approach</h4>
<p>There are mainly two approaches in which the pre-trained networks can be used:-</p>
<p><i>1. <b>Feature Extractor</b> and then the classifier is trained to do the classification</i> .</p>
<p><i>2. <b>Subset of the classifier</b> to get finetuned on the new tasks.</i><p>
